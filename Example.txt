A user (whether a student or a teacher) is referanced by a UUID so that if their name ever needs to be changed (E.G because of a typo or error), the process can be simple.

A user has the following attributes:
	- A name
	- An/multiple assigned teacher(s)/student(s)
	- The type of user (E.G Staff, teacher, student) to define permissions.

A work record has the following attributes:
	- A UUID of who owns it
	- A date (To identify between records with the same record ID)

A poke has the following attributes:
	- The message it contains
	- The UUID of the user who sent it
	- The UUID of the user who it's going to
	- A date and time sent





Example:

Users:
	- Billy, UUID 1, Assigned to UUID 3, User type student
	- John, UUID 2, Assigned to UUID 4, User type student
	- Philip, UUID 3, User type teacher
	- Martha, UUID 4, User type teacher

Records:
	- 15/84/96, UUID 1
	- 15/85/96, UUID 1
	- 15/86/96, UUID 1
	- 15/84/96, UUID 2
	- 15/85/96, UUID 2
	- 15/86/96, UUID 2

Pokes:
	- To UUID 4, From UUID 2, message: I'm sorry for breaking the pencil Martha, Sent at 6:23 PM on 15/84/96
	- To UUID 2, From UUID 4, message: It's alright :), Sent at 7:41 PM on 15/84/96
